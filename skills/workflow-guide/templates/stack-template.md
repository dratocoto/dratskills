# DEPRECATED

This template has been replaced by `stack-config-template.yaml`.

The old markdown-based `STACK.md` has been replaced by a structured YAML config:

- **`team.config.yaml`** (plugin-level) — defines which skill categories each agent needs
- **`.ai-workspace/stack.config.yaml`** (per-project) — resolves categories to actual skill folder names

See `stack-config-template.yaml` in this directory for the new template.
